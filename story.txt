There once was a man wearing lederhose and walking his hund.
While eating a gebaeck that he shared with his hund.
At the end of the street, they arrived at the biergarten to meet with their freunde.
It turns out the man is very wettbewerbsfaehig when it comes to gebaeck.
The man with his hund and fruende, they decided to go to the flughafen.
The man took his BMW and his fruende took his Audi; it was a race.
On the way they saw an advertisement for Rammstein playing at the local ratskeller.
They were very aufgeregt to see the stage in flammen stehen during the concert.
It was so hot that after they left they had to sit in the car and blast the Klimaanlage
But that all changed when the Mehlhase attacked.
The man and his fruende cranked up the Rammstein and started headbanging rapidly which confused the Mehlhase enough to stop attacking.
Exhausted from throwing a barrage of bot, the mehlhase retreats to sit and relax in the front of the limaanlage.
But in a big bang of sparks the kilmaanlage exploded and was in flammen stehen, leaving Mehlhase slightly singed.
